# jtypes
A type hierarchy visualizer for Java types. You can add types to the board by entering their fully qualified name, and you can drag them around once they've been added. Note: This app was originally created in September 2020 but was not uploaded to GitHub until October 2021.

Right-clicking a type gives you several options, one of which is adding all of that type's supertypes to the board.
